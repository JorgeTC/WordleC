# WordleC++

A program to choose the best word to play in Wordle.
The user must include a word and the pattern of colours that Wordle has returned.
The pattern will be a sequence of 5 digits.
Digit `0` means a grey letter, `1` is a green letter and `2` is a yellow letter.

This will work for any language.
To do so, you just need to include a txt file inside `res` folder.
The wanted file must be named `list.txt`.
